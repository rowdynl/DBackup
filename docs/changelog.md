# Changelog

All notable changes to DBackup are documented here.

## v2.1.0
*Release: In Progress*

### ✨ Features

- **influxdb**: Added InfluxDB adapter supporting both v1 (`influxd backup`) and v2 (`influx backup`) with full backup/restore pipeline, per-database and per-bucket selection, TAR archive format with embedded metadata, and HTTP-based connection testing. Bundled `influxd` (1.8.10) and `influx` CLI (2.7.5) into the Docker image.

## v2.0.1 - SSH Connection Fix with new Credential Profiles
*Released: May 3, 2026*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **sources**: Fixed "SSH username is required" error when testing an SSH database source connection that uses an SSH Credential Profile. The test-ssh route now resolves the credential profile before validating the username, matching the behavior of the main test-connection route.
- **sources**: Fixed missing placeholder text for SSH Host and SSH Port fields in the SSH Connection tab - added generic `sshHost`, `sshPort`, `sshUsername`, and `sshPrivateKey` entries to `PLACEHOLDERS` in `form-constants.ts`.

### 🧪 Tests

- **update-service**: Fixed 3 failing unit tests that hardcoded `'2.0.0'` as `currentVersion` - tests now import `version` dynamically from `package.json` so they stay correct after every version bump.

## v2.0.0 - Credential Profiles, Naming Template, Cloning, and Major Refactor
*Released: May 3, 2026*

> ⚠️ **Breaking:** Existing Sources, Destinations and Notifications that store credentials inline will require a Credential Profile to be assigned before they come back online. Create the matching profiles in the Security Vault, then assign them to each adapter via the edit form. This has to be done manually for each adapter, so take some time before upgrading. The new Credential Profile system is a critical security improvement that centralizes and encrypts all secrets in the Vault, but it does require some manual migration effort for existing adapters. New adapters created after the update will require credential profiles from the start.

### ✨ Features

- **credentials**: Added the Generic Credential Profile System - reusable, AES-256-GCM encrypted credential profiles (Username/Password, SSH Key, Access Key, Token, SMTP) that adapters reference instead of storing secrets inline. Profiles are managed in the Security Vault, assigned via a searchable picker in the adapter form, and automatically merged into every backup, restore, health check, and notification at runtime.
- **setup**: Added Credential Profile picker to the Quick Setup Wizard Source, Destination, and Notification steps - the picker now renders identically to the standalone "Add Source/Destination/Notification" dialogs, including SSH credential support. The selected profile IDs are included in the adapter creation payload.
- **ui**: Added clone (copy) button to Sources, Destinations, Notifications, and Backup Jobs - cloning creates a duplicate with the name suffix "(Copy)" and carries over all settings including Vault credential references. Cloned jobs start as disabled to prevent accidental execution. Resolves [#34](https://github.com/Skyfay/DBackup/issues/34)
- **storage**: Added `jurisdiction` field to the Cloudflare R2 adapter (`Standard`, `EU`, `FedRAMP`) - EU-jurisdiction buckets require the `*.eu.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` endpoint, without this setting they return "Access Denied" or "bucket does not exist"
- **website**: Added a new Website https://dbackup.app
- **scheduler**: Added a UI setting in Settings > General to configure the scheduler timezone without changing the `TZ` environment variable. When set, the DB value takes explicit priority over `TZ` for all cron jobs. Thanks @iberlob ([#41](https://github.com/Skyfay/DBackup/pull/41))
- **backup**: Added a configurable filename pattern for backup files. Patterns support tokens (`{name}`, `{db_name}`, `yyyy`, `MM`, `dd`, `HH`, `mm`, `ss`) with a live preview and clickable token chips in Settings > General. Thanks @iberlob ([#41](https://github.com/Skyfay/DBackup/pull/41))
- **2fa**: Added a "Can't scan? Copy the secret key" button to the 2FA setup dialog so users who cannot scan the QR code can manually enter the TOTP secret into their authenticator app. ([#39](https://github.com/Skyfay/DBackup/issues/39))

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **storage**: Fixed FTP/FTPS adapter uploading to a doubled path when the job folder contains subdirectories - `basic-ftp`'s `ensureDir` changes the working directory to the created directory, causing the subsequent `uploadFrom` call to resolve the relative path against the new CWD instead of root, resulting in a 553 Permission denied error from the server. A `cd("/")` is now called after `ensureDir` to reset the working directory before the upload.
- **notifications**: Fixed Email (SMTP) `From` and `To` fields appearing in both the Connection and Configuration tabs - removed `from` and `to` from `NOTIFICATION_CONNECTION_KEYS` so they only render in the Configuration tab
- **storage**: Fixed Google Drive, OneDrive, and Dropbox OAuth redirect URIs using `req.nextUrl.origin` (resolves to `0.0.0.0:3000` internally) instead of `BETTER_AUTH_URL` when deployed behind a reverse proxy, causing OAuth failures - Thanks @garrettstoupe
- **jobs**: Fixed pipeline Compression selector being permanently disabled for all adapter types on the job form - `isNativeCompressionActive` now only evaluates to true when a PostgreSQL source is selected and a native compression algorithm (Legacy, Gzip, LZ4, ZSTD) is active. Non-PostgreSQL adapters can always choose a compression algorithm.

### 🔒 Security

- **deps**: Updated `next` from `16.2.2` to `16.2.4` - fixes DoS with Server Components (GHSA-q4gf-8mx6-v5v3)
- **deps**: Updated `@scalar/api-reference-react` from `0.9.18` to `0.9.31` - resolves critical `protobufjs` arbitrary code execution (GHSA-xq3m-2v4x-88gg) via transitive dependency update
- **deps**: Updated `better-auth` and `@better-auth/sso` from `1.5.6` to `1.6.9` - resolves `drizzle-orm` SQL injection (GHSA-gpj5-g38j-94v9) and 4 `@xmldom/xmldom` XML injection/DoS vulnerabilities via transitive dependency updates
- **deps**: Added `vite@^7.3.2` as direct devDependency - fixes 3 high-severity path traversal and arbitrary file read vulnerabilities in dev server (GHSA-v2wj-q39q-566r, GHSA-p9ff-h696-f583, GHSA-4w7w-66w2-5vf9)
- **deps**: Updated `nodemailer` from `7.0.13` to `8.0.7` - fixes SMTP command injection via CRLF in transport name and envelope size (GHSA-vvjj-xcjg-gr5g, GHSA-c7w3-x93f-qmm8)

### 🎨 Improvements

- **history**: Replaced native browser scrollbar with Shadcn `ScrollArea` in the Notification Log preview dialog, consistent with the Activity Log dialog
- **jobs**: Renamed "Security" tab to "Advanced" in the backup job form - the tab contains both Compression and Encryption settings, so "Advanced" is more accurate
- **refactor**: Major codebase reorganization - split three oversized files (`config-service.ts`, `restore-service.ts`, `adapters/definitions.ts`) into focused sub-modules via the Facade Pattern, and grouped all loose files in `src/lib/` (20 files into 6 folders), `src/services/` (19 files into 9 folders), and `src/app/actions/` (14 files into 5 folders) into a clear directory structure. Also consolidated `src/types.ts` into `src/types/index.ts`, all ~600 import paths across source, tests, and docs were updated and public APIs remain unchanged

### 🔄 Changed

- **docs**: Renamed `wiki/` folder to `docs/` and moved documentation domain from `dbackup.app` to `docs.dbackup.app` across all configuration files, app source code, CI/CD workflows, and docs content
- **deps**: Bumped minor/patch versions for `react`, `react-dom`, `tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/postcss`, `eslint-config-next`, `vitest`, `basic-ftp`, `@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `@aws-sdk/lib-storage`, `jsdom`, `mongodb`, `mssql`, `tar-stream`, `zod`, `react-hook-form`, `lucide-react` - no breaking changes

### 📝 Documentation

- **SSO**: Fixed incorrect SSO callback URL in all provider setup guides - the correct path is `/api/auth/sso/callback/{provider-id}`, not `/api/auth/callback/{provider-id}`.
- **credentials**: Added a new user-guide page `security/credential-profiles.md` documenting types, slots, inline creation flow, reference tracking, REVEAL semantics, and the REST surface, added a top-of-page note to `security/encryption.md` clarifying that the Vault now hosts both an Encryption tab and a Credentials tab, added the page to the security sidebar in `.vitepress/config.mts`
- **api**: Documented the full `/api/credentials` REST surface in `public/openapi.yaml` under the `Vault` tag, including a `CredentialType` enum and per-type `data` schemas (`UsernamePasswordData`, `SshKeyData`, `AccessKeyData`, `TokenData`, `SmtpData`), plus a new `BadRequest` shared response
- **api**: Added missing `POST /jobs/{id}/clone`, `POST /adapters/{id}/clone`, and `POST /executions/{id}/cancel` endpoints to both `public/openapi.yaml` and `api-docs/openapi.yaml`. Fixed `ExecutionStatus` schema to include the `Cancelled` value. Extended `/adapters/test-connection` request body with optional `primaryCredentialId` and `sshCredentialId` fields. Synced Vault tag description between both files.
- **adapters**: Updated all database source guides (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, MSSQL, SQLite) to replace inline credential fields with Credential Profile pickers (`USERNAME_PASSWORD` or `SSH_KEY` type). Added `::: info Credential Profile required` boxes with links to the credential-profiles page.
- **adapters**: Updated all destination guides (SFTP, FTP, SMB, WebDAV, rsync, Amazon S3, S3-Compatible, Cloudflare R2, Hetzner Object Storage) to replace inline credential fields with Credential Profile pickers (`SSH_KEY`, `USERNAME_PASSWORD`, or `ACCESS_KEY` type). Added setup guide steps to create the credential profile first. Added Jurisdiction field and EU jurisdiction warning to R2 guide.
- **adapters**: Updated Email (SMTP) notification guide to replace inline User/Password fields with `SMTP` credential profile picker.
- **jobs**: Added "Filename Pattern" section to `jobs/index.md` documenting the configurable filename pattern setting (Settings → General), all supported tokens (`{name}`, `{db_name}`, date/time tokens), live preview, and clickable token chips.
- **first-steps**: Updated Quick Setup "Advanced tab" reference (renamed from "Security" in v2.0.0) and revised Manual Setup Step 2 (MySQL example) to reference creating a `USERNAME_PASSWORD` credential profile before adding the source.
- **profile-settings**: Added note about "Can't scan? Copy the secret key" button in the 2FA setup dialog.

### 🗑️ Removed

- **dead-code**: Removed unused `checkPermission as _checkPermission` alias imports from `actions/backup/encryption.ts` and `actions/backup/upload.ts` - the symbol was never called in either file
- **dead-code**: Removed 43-line developer thought-stream comment block from `uploadAvatar()` in `actions/backup/upload.ts`, along with a redundant `await getUserPermissions()` call that served no authorization purpose

### 🧪 Tests

- **coverage**: Massively expanded the unit test suite across the entire codebase - added hundreds of new tests covering all database adapters (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, MongoDB, Redis, SQLite), all storage adapters, notification adapters, the backup pipeline steps, services, auth, crypto, OIDC, and core utilities, bringing the majority of source files to 100% statement and line coverage.

## v1.4.8 - Scheduler, Runner & TLS Fixes
*Released: April 24, 2026*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **scheduler**: Fixed a race condition where concurrent `scheduler.refresh()` calls (e.g. saving a job while config-backup settings are updated simultaneously) could create orphaned `node-cron` tasks that are never stopped. These ghost tasks could cause scheduled jobs to fire more than once per cron interval
- **scheduler**: Fixed the scheduler singleton not being stored on `globalThis` in production mode (`NODE_ENV=production`). If the module was re-imported in a fresh module scope (a known Next.js standalone behavior), a second independent `BackupScheduler` instance with its own cron tasks was created
- **runner**: Fixed a TOCTOU race condition in `performExecution` that caused duplicate backup files when two or more jobs are scheduled at the same cron minute. Both `processQueue()` calls ran concurrently, both found the same `Pending` execution, and both ran the full backup pipeline. The execution is now claimed atomically via a conditional `updateMany` (`status: "Pending" → "Running"`), the call that gets `count=0` back exits immediately without running the backup ([#32](https://github.com/Skyfay/DBackup/issues/32))
- **tls**: Fixed self-signed certificate not including the hostname from `BETTER_AUTH_URL` as a SubjectAltName (SAN). Browsers like Brave (and per RFC, all browsers) block `fetch()` API calls when the SAN does not match the accessed hostname, even after manually accepting the certificate warning for the page itself. The generated SAN now includes the hostname/IP extracted from `BETTER_AUTH_URL` in addition to `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`. On startup, if an existing self-signed cert is missing the configured hostname, it is automatically regenerated. The "Regenerate" button in Settings also benefits from this fix

### 🎨 Improvements

- **scheduler**: `scheduler.refresh()` is now fire-and-forget at all call sites (job create/update/delete, config-backup settings save, system-task API). The DB write completes and the response is returned to the browser immediately, the scheduler rebuilds its task list in the background. This eliminates the UI hang that some users noticed when saving settings

### 🔧 CI/CD

- **docker**: Added a BuildKit cache mount (`--mount=type=cache,target=/app/.next/cache`) to the builder stage in the Dockerfile. Combined with the existing `type=gha,mode=max` layer cache in the release workflow, Next.js reuses its webpack/SWC artefacts for unchanged modules between releases - cutting image build times significantly

## v1.4.7 - PostgreSQL Compression, MSSQL Dump Fixes & Docker Metadata
*Released: April 22, 2026*

### ✨ Features

- **postgresql**: Added per-job native PostgreSQL dump compression. Jobs with a PostgreSQL source now expose an "Algorithm" selector (Legacy Gzip-6, None, Gzip, LZ4, ZSTD) and a "Level" input under the Security tab. The selection maps directly to `pg_dump -Z`, allowing e.g. `-Z zstd:3` or `-Z lz4:1` without modifying the source adapter config ([#24](https://github.com/Skyfay/DBackup/issues/24))

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **postgresql**: Fixed hardcoded `-Z 6` in the PostgreSQL dump adapter. Previously, `pg_dump` always ran with Gzip level 6 regardless of the job's compression setting, resulting in silent double-compression when pipeline Gzip or Brotli was enabled. The adapter now derives the `-Z` flag from the job's `pgCompression` setting (legacy jobs are unaffected) ([#24](https://github.com/Skyfay/DBackup/issues/24))
- **mssql**: Fixed `Dump failed: No database specified for backup` when no databases were selected in the job. The MSSQL adapter now auto-discovers all user databases (matching the behavior of MySQL/PostgreSQL adapters) instead of aborting ([#30](https://github.com/Skyfay/DBackup/issues/30))
- **backup**: Fixed all database adapters (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, etc.) only backing up one database when no explicit selection was made in the job config. The source config's default `database` field was leaking through and overriding the intended "backup all" behavior ([#30](https://github.com/Skyfay/DBackup/issues/30))

### 🔧 CI/CD

- **docker**: Added `lz4` and `zstd` Alpine packages to the base image so that `pg_dump` (postgresql18-client) can use LZ4 and ZSTD native compression at runtime
- **docker**: Added OCI standard labels to Docker image (`title`, `description`, `url`, `source`, `version`, `revision`, `created`, `licenses`, `vendor`) via `docker/metadata-action@v5` for better registry compatibility and dependency bot integration ([#27](https://github.com/Skyfay/DBackup/pull/27)) - Thanks @Erwan-loot
- **codecov**: Added Codecov integration - `codecov.yml`, `@vitest/coverage-v8`, `test:coverage` script, lcov reporter in `vitest.config.ts`, and coverage upload step in `validate.yml` using OIDC (no token secret required)

## v1.4.6 - Issue Templates and extension corrections
*Released: April 19, 2026*

### 🔄 Changed

- **backup**: Multi-database backups now use `.tar` file extension instead of the adapter-specific extension (e.g. `.sql`), correctly reflecting the TAR archive format ([#25](https://github.com/Skyfay/DBackup/issues/25))

### 🔧 CI/CD

- **github**: Added GitHub Issue templates for Bug Reports, Feature Requests, Questions/Support, and Documentation Issues

## v1.4.5 - SSH Backup Fixes with single database selection
*Released: April 19, 2026*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **postgres**: Fixed single-database backups via SSH running `pg_dump` locally instead of on the remote server, causing "Connection refused" errors ([#22](https://github.com/Skyfay/DBackup/issues/22))
- **mongodb**: Fixed same SSH bypass bug for single-database `mongodump` backups

## v1.4.4 - HTTPS Redirect Loop Fix
*Released: April 18, 2026*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **auth**: Fixed infinite redirect loop (ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS) after login in Docker/HTTPS mode caused by middleware not recognizing the `__Secure-` cookie prefix that browsers set for HTTPS sessions

- **Platforms**: linux/amd64, linux/arm64


## v1.4.3 - TypeScript Migration, Prisma Upgrade & Security Fixes
*Released: April 5, 2026*

### 🎨 Improvements

- **server**: Converted `custom-server.js` to TypeScript (`custom-server.ts`) for consistent type safety across the codebase - compiled to JS during Docker build via dedicated `tsconfig.server.json`

### 🔄 Changed

- **database**: Upgraded Prisma ORM from v5 to v6 (v6.19.3) for continued security patches and bug fixes
- **SSO**: Migrated SSO credential decryption from deprecated `$use` middleware to `$extends` query extension API
- **auth**: Upgraded better-auth from v1.4.17 to v1.5.6 with SSO hardening, Prisma adapter fixes, and security improvements
- **dependencies**: Updated all patch/minor dependencies - Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Zod, AWS SDK, Vitest and 20+ other packages

### 🗑️ Removed

- **auth**: Removed deprecated `@better-auth/cli` package (replaced by `npx auth` CLI)

### 🔧 CI/CD

- **Docker**: Prisma CLI version in Dockerfile is now dynamically read from `package.json` at build time instead of being hardcoded, ensuring automatic version sync

### 🐳 Docker

- **Image**: `skyfay/dbackup:v1.4.3`
- **Also tagged as**: `latest`, `v1`
- **Platforms**: linux/amd64, linux/arm64


## v1.4.2 - Security Fixes
*Released: April 2, 2026*

### 🔒 Security

- **OneDrive**: Fixed polynomial ReDoS vulnerability (CWE-1333) in folder path sanitization by replacing regex with iterative string trimming
- **CI/CD**: Added explicit `permissions: contents: read` to `sync-gitlab.yml` and `validate.yml` workflows to restrict default `GITHUB_TOKEN` privileges (CWE-275)
- **Google Drive**: Fixed incomplete string escaping in query builder - backslashes are now escaped before single quotes to prevent query injection (CWE-20, CWE-116)
- **API Keys**: Upgraded hash from SHA-256 to scrypt (N=16384, r=8, p=1) with automatic migration for existing keys (CWE-916)
- **Filesystem API**: Expanded blocked-prefix list for sensitive system paths - now covers Linux (`/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`), macOS (`/System`, `/Library/Keychains`), and Windows WSL paths with dedicated `sanitizePath()` validation (CWE-22)
- **TAR Extraction**: Added Zip Slip protection in multi-DB TAR extraction using `path.basename()` validation (CWE-22)
- **MSSQL Restore**: Added Zip Slip protection in MSSQL TAR extraction using `path.basename()` validation (CWE-22)
- **TLS Server**: Removed environment-derived path from log output to prevent clear-text logging of sensitive directory info (CWE-532)

### 🧪 Tests

- **Lint Guards**: Fixed incomplete regex escaping in glob-to-regex conversion for `no-console` and `no-config-any` test helpers (CWE-116)
- **API Keys**: Added unit tests for scrypt hashing, deterministic hash output, SHA-256 legacy migration path, and scrypt-is-not-SHA-256 verification

### 🐳 Docker

## v1.4.1 - PostgreSQL Client Cleanup
*Released: April 2, 2026*

### 🎨 Improvements

- **PostgreSQL**: Restore warning for PostgreSQL ≤ 16 now explains that `SET transaction_timeout` is a cosmetic pg_restore 18 issue and does not affect the restore
- **codebase**: Replaced all em dashes with hyphens across source code, docs, and config files for typographic consistency

### 🗑️ Removed

- **PostgreSQL**: Removed multi-version pg_dump/pg_restore strategy (PG 14, 16, 17, 18) - only PostgreSQL 18 client is now installed, which is backward compatible with all supported server versions (12–18)

### 🔧 CI/CD

- **Docker**: Simplified Dockerfile by removing postgresql14/16/17-client packages and multi-version symlink setup, reducing image size

## v1.4.0 - Live History Redesign
*Released: March 31, 2026*

### ✨ Features

- **logging**: Pipeline stage system for backups (Queued → Initializing → Dumping → Processing → Uploading → Verifying → Retention → Notifications → Completed) and restores (Downloading → Decrypting → Decompressing → Restoring Database → Completed) with automatic progress calculation and duration tracking per stage
- **ui**: LogViewer redesign with pipeline stage grouping, duration badges, pending stage placeholders, and auto-expanding latest stage during execution
- **ui**: Real-time speed (MB/s) and byte progress display for all backup and restore operations - dump, compress, encrypt, upload, download, decrypt, decompress, and SFTP transfer

### 🎨 Improvements

- **logging**: MongoDB adapter now buffers stderr output and emits it as a single structured log entry instead of flooding the log with individual lines
- **logging**: SQLite adapter logs now use typed log levels for consistent display
- **storage**: Google Drive adapter now reports intermediate upload progress instead of only 100% at completion
- **storage**: Download progress tracking added to S3, SFTP, Google Drive, OneDrive, WebDAV, and FTP adapters for restore operations
- **restore**: MySQL/MariaDB SSH restore now shows SFTP upload progress with real-time byte tracking

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **storage**: Fixed local filesystem adapter logging "Preparing local destination" twice per upload

### 🐳 Docker

- **Image**: `skyfay/dbackup:v1.4.0`
- **Also tagged as**: `latest`, `v1`
- **Platforms**: linux/amd64, linux/arm64


## v1.3.0 - SSH Remote Execution
*Released: March 29, 2026*

### ✨ Features

- **ssh**: SSH remote execution mode for MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Redis - database tools (mysqldump, pg_dump, mongodump, redis-cli) run directly on the remote host via SSH instead of requiring a local client or SSH tunnel
- **ssh**: New shared SSH infrastructure (`src/lib/ssh/`) with reusable client, shell escaping, remote binary detection, and per-adapter argument builders
- **ssh**: Generic SSH connection test endpoint - "Test SSH" button now works for all SSH-capable adapters, not just MSSQL
- **ui**: SSH configuration tab in the source editor for all SSH-capable database adapters (MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis) with connection mode selector
- **sqlite**: Added "Test SSH Connection" button to the SQLite SSH configuration tab, matching all other SSH-capable adapters

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **backup**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB backup jobs with no database selected now auto-discover all databases at runtime - MySQL no longer fails with "No database specified", PostgreSQL no longer defaults to the username as database name, and MongoDB SSH listing was fixed by switching `mongosh --eval` to single quotes to prevent bash `!` history expansion from silently corrupting the command, backup metadata is now correctly populated for restore mapping.
- **restore**: Restore page no longer shows SQLite-style "Overwrite / Restore as New" UI for server-based adapters - now shows a target database name input when database names are unknown, and auto-discovers database names in backup metadata for future backups
- **ssh**: Fixed MySQL/MongoDB SSH restore not consuming stdout, which could cause backpressure and hang/crash the remote process
- **restore**: Fixed MySQL SSH restore crashing the Node.js process with OOM (16 GB heap) when restoring large databases - stderr log output is now rate-limited (max 50 messages, 500 chars each) to prevent unbounded memory growth
- **restore**: Fixed MySQL restore via SSH failing with "Server has gone away" on large dumps - `mysql` client now uses `--max-allowed-packet=64M` to handle large legacy INSERT statements
- **backup**: Fixed MySQL dump producing huge INSERT statements that cause OOM kills on remote servers during restore - `mysqldump` now uses `--net-buffer-length=16384` to limit each INSERT to ~16 KB, and `mysql` client `--max-allowed-packet` reduced from 512M to 64M to minimize client memory allocatione
- **ui**: Fixed Download Link modal overflowing the viewport when a link is generated - dialog now has a max height and scrollable body
- **ui**: Fixed Job Status donut chart legend breaking to multiple lines with uneven layout when 3+ statuses (e.g. Completed, Failed, Cancelled) are shown - legend items now flow naturally and stay centered

### 🔒 Security

- **ssh**: Fixed database passwords (MYSQL_PWD, PGPASSWORD) being exposed in execution logs when a remote process is killed by OOM or signal - `remoteEnv()` now uses `export` statements instead of inline env var prefix, and the MySQL stderr handler redacts known secrets from all output

### 🎨 Improvements

- **ui**: Redesigned source form for SSH-capable adapters - Connection Mode selector now appears first (like SQLite), SSH Connection tab is shown first in SSH mode so users configure SSH before database credentials
- **ui**: Restore page now shows skeleton loading while target databases are fetched via SSH - version compatibility, database mapping, and action buttons are blocked until loading completes
- **ui**: Sources and Destinations pages now auto-refresh every 10 seconds to keep health status up to date
- **sqlite**: Refactored SQLite SSH client into shared SSH module for code reuse across all database adapters
- **sqlite**: SQLite SSH connection test now uses `remoteBinaryCheck()` from the shared SSH library instead of manual binary checks, `try/finally` pattern ensures SSH connections are always closed, exit code null handling fixed in dump

### 📝 Documentation

- **wiki**: Updated all database source guides (MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis) with SSH mode configuration, prerequisites, setup guides, and troubleshooting
- **wiki**: New "Connection Modes" overview section on the Sources index page explaining Direct vs SSH mode and shared SSH config fields
- **wiki**: Added SSH remote execution architecture section to the Developer Guide (database adapters, adapter system, architecture)
- **wiki**: Each adapter guide now lists required CLI tools for the remote host with installation commands per OS

### 🧪 Tests

- **ssh**: Added 60 unit tests for shared SSH utilities covering shell escaping, environment variable export, SSH mode detection, config extraction, and argument builders for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis

## v1.2.1 - Execution Cancellation, MSSQL Progress & Dashboard Polish
*Released: March 26, 2026*

### ✨ Features

- **execution**: Cancel running or pending executions from the live log dialog - a "Cancel" button now appears in the execution header when a backup or restore is in progress
- **execution**: New `Cancelled` status for executions - cancelled jobs are cleanly marked with proper log entries instead of showing as failed

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **mssql**: Fixed Database Explorer and Restore page showing 0 databases for MSSQL sources - replaced global singleton connection pool (`sql.connect()`) with independent per-operation pools (`new ConnectionPool()`) to prevent concurrent requests from closing each other's connections
- **mssql**: Fixed large database backups/restores hanging and timing out - `BACKUP DATABASE` and `RESTORE DATABASE` queries now run without request timeout (previously limited to 5 minutes, causing failures on databases >5 GB)
- **explorer**: Fixed Database Explorer not displaying server version - removed broken parallel `test-connection` call and now uses version info returned by `database-stats` endpoint

### 🎨 Improvements

- **mssql**: SQL Server progress messages (e.g. "10 percent processed") are now streamed to the execution log in real-time instead of only appearing after the backup/restore completes
- **dashboard**: All dashboard widgets (activity chart, job status donut, latest jobs list) now display the `Cancelled` status with a neutral gray color

### 🐳 Docker

## v1.2.0 - HTTPS by Default, Certificate Management & Per-Adapter Health Notifications
*Released: March 25, 2026*

> ⚠️ **Breaking:** Volume mounts have changed. Replace `./db:/app/db` and `./storage:/app/storage` with a single `./data:/data` mount. Then move the current data to the new structure after first startup. Update `BETTER_AUTH_URL` to `https://` - HTTPS is now the default protocol. Set `DISABLE_HTTPS=true` if you use a TLS-terminating reverse proxy but its not recommended in terms of security.

### ✨ Features

- **notifications**: Per-adapter health check notification opt-out - sources and destinations can individually disable offline/recovery alerts via a toggle in the Configuration tab while health checks continue running
- **security**: Built-in HTTPS support - DBackup now defaults to HTTPS with an auto-generated self-signed certificate on first start, protecting all traffic including database passwords, encryption keys, and session cookies
- **security**: Certificate management UI - new "Certificate" tab in System Settings to view certificate details (issuer, expiry, fingerprint), upload custom PEM certificates, or regenerate self-signed certs
- **security**: HSTS header - when accessed via HTTPS, DBackup now sends `Strict-Transport-Security` to enforce future HTTPS connections in the browser
- **security**: Auto-renewal for self-signed certificates - expired self-signed certs are automatically regenerated on container start, custom certificates are never replaced, only a warning is logged

### 🔄 Changed

- **server**: Default protocol changed from HTTP to HTTPS - set `DISABLE_HTTPS=true` to use plain HTTP (e.g. behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy)
- **docker**: Consolidated volume mounts into single `/data` directory - replaces separate `/app/db`, `/app/storage` mounts with one `./data:/data` mount containing `db/`, `storage/`, and `certs/` subdirectories. `/backups` remains a separate optional mount for local backups

### 🎨 Improvements

- **ui**: Edit Configuration dialog now uses Shadcn ScrollArea instead of native browser overflow for consistent scrollbar styling

### 🧪 Tests

- **security**: Added 21 unit tests for `certificate-service` covering certificate info parsing, upload validation (PEM format, cert-key matching, temp file cleanup), self-signed regeneration, and HTTPS toggle

## v1.1.0 - Notification System Expansion & UI Improvements
*Released: March 24, 2026*

### ✨ Features

- **notifications**: New "Connection Offline" system notification event - sends an alert when a source or destination becomes unreachable after repeated health check failures, with configurable repeat reminder (default 24h)
- **notifications**: New "Connection Recovered" system notification event - sends an alert when a previously offline source or destination becomes reachable again, including downtime duration

### 🎨 Improvements

- **ui**: Empty state on Settings → Notifications now links directly to the Notifications page to create an adapter
- **ui**: Redesigned permission picker for API Key and Group dialogs - replaced cramped scroll area with a spacious 3-column category card grid, global select/deselect all, and per-category count badges for much better overview

### 📝 Documentation

- **docs**: Added "No Vendor Lock-In" messaging to README and Wiki - highlights that backups are standard dumps, decryptable offline with the Recovery Kit and a standalone script

### 🧪 Tests

- **notifications**: Updated event count assertions to match new health check events (14 event types, 12 system event definitions, added `health` category)
- **runner**: Fixed "Closing rpc while fetch was pending" CI failure in notification-logic tests - added missing mocks for `dashboard-service` and `notification-log-service` to prevent unresolved dynamic imports during test teardown

## v1.0.7 - PostgreSQL Version Mismatch Fix & Docker Build Validation
*Released: March 22, 2026*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **PostgreSQL**: Fixed pg_dump version mismatch in Docker container - PostgreSQL 17 backups failed because `postgresql17-client` and `postgresql18-client` were not installed, causing fallback to pg_dump 16

### 🔧 CI/CD

- **Docker**: Added build-time validation for all pg_dump versions - Docker build now fails immediately if any PostgreSQL client binary is missing or has the wrong version

### 🐳 Docker

## v1.0.5 - Docker Permissions & Environment Variables
*Released: March 20, 2026*

### ✨ Features

- **Docker**: Configurable `PUID`/`PGID` environment variables (default: `1001`) - the entrypoint adjusts the runtime user at startup to match host volume permissions

### 🎨 Improvements

- **Dockerfile**: Dedicated `docker-entrypoint.sh` replaces inline CMD - validates `PUID`/`PGID`, conditionally chowns `/pnpm` only when ownership differs, and runs `node` as PID 1 for proper signal handling
- **Dockerfile**: Global Prisma CLI pinned to exact version (`5.22.0`) matching `package.json` to prevent version drift
- **Dockerfile**: Merged Prisma generate and Next.js build into a single layer, consistent `--chown=1001:1001` on all COPY directives

- **Platforms**: linux/amd64, linux/arm64

## v1.0.3 - Docker Optimization & MSSQL Improvements
*Released: March 19, 2026*

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **MSSQL**: Backup and restore errors now show the actual SQL Server cause instead of only "terminating abnormally" by extracting preceding error messages
- **MSSQL**: Database Explorer now correctly shows table counts by querying each database individually instead of using a broken cross-database `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` subquery

### 🎨 Improvements

- **Dockerfile**: Global Prisma install switched from `npm` to `pnpm` for consistency and smaller image size
- **Dockerfile**: corepack activated in the base stage so all build stages inherit pnpm without reinstalling
- **Dockerfile**: Build now uses `pnpm run build` and `pnpm prisma generate` consistently instead of `npm`/`npx`
- **Dockerfile**: Combined base-stage RUN layers (corepack + PG symlinks), added `COPY --link` for layer-independent caching, merged runner RUN layers, and added pnpm store mount-cache for faster dependency installs
- **Dockerfile**: `.dockerignore` extended to exclude `wiki/`, `api-docs/`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE` to reduce build context size

### 🛠 CI/CD

- **pipeline**: GitHub Releases are now auto-generated from `wiki/changelog.md` on every version tag push - no manual copy-paste required
- **pipeline**: Removed QEMU from Docker builds - amd64 and arm64 now build natively on their respective GitHub runners
- **pipeline**: Switched Docker layer cache from GHCR registry to GitHub Actions cache for faster cache hits
- **Dockerfile**: Fixed ARM64 build failure (`invalid user index: -1`) by using numeric UID/GID (`1001:1001`) instead of user/group names in `COPY --link --chown` directives

### 📝 Documentation

- **wiki**: New user guide article - [Encryption Key](https://docs.dbackup.app/user-guide/security/encryption-key): explains what `ENCRYPTION_KEY` protects, what happens when the key is lost or mismatched, and recovery options

### 🐳 Docker
